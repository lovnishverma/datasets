## 📌 Tip

For code integration and automatic downloads, you can often use Python libraries such as:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("imdb")  # Hugging Face example
````

You can also automate downloads from Kaggle via API:

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d username/dataset-name
```
